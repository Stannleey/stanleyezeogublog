            <div>
                <p>I did not feel independent or happy this morning. Yet I struggled to suppress hope which, like a joyful friend, tickled my sad mind in a bid to make me smile. It spoke of joy which came in the morning, but I would have none of that. Last Independence Day, I had posted: ‘Evening came, and morning came: a new dawn.’ Although that dawn was new, it came with the old reoccurrence of Nigerian tragedies. Last year it was hope that inspired that post. This year, it was my failure to despair that inspired me to post it again. I half hoped the rays of this year’s new dawn would reveal joy — a joy within the reach of eager Nigerian hands, willing Nigerian spirits, and forlorn Nigerian youths. This new dawn was a Sunday, the day of joy, so I had to go to church where hope in lasting peace was the reason for faith.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        I went to Holy Family Catholic Church, Life Camp, hoping to stumble into another proper Catholic Mass with an emphatic choir that would sing my spirits into the divine place of eternal joy. Escaping lateness by the whiskers, I entered the big church that was quiet despite the chatter of the people outside the building. There were no green and white decorations apart from the choristers and a few parishioners who wore green and white attires. The apathy towards the national celebration was like a partially visible spirit — seen in people like me who cared less and hidden behind the green and white covers of others who appeared patriotic. The altar table seemed to sympathise with my apathy as it was not clad in green and white, but this was not actually in the spirit of apathy. It was in the Catholic spirit to dress the altar in the royal colours of white and gold on days of solemnity. And today, being Nigeria’s independence day, Mass was for the solemnity of Our Lady, Queen and Patroness of Nigeria.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        The choir looked like they were only prepared to wear green and white, and not for the solemnity because the entrance procession had almost commenced when they began the entrance hymn in a laborious singing. The sanctus bell announced the procession which was led by the smoke from the thurible. The priest, like someone important, was saved for the last in the procession. He began the Mass without the explicit intention of motivating a congregation that wanted to be sad about a sad situation. He wore a solemn aura over his chasuble and only said that we would listen to the Queen of Nigeria’s advice to Nigerians. This made me eager to hear his homily.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        His preaching began with warning the ushers never to bring him irrelevant announcements before he began his homily. Then he said that the Blessed Virgin’s message was her submission to the will of God despite her sufferings. And her soul rejoiced in God her saviour. He also talked about Joseph’s discernment which was always accompanied by obedience. My mind went to my friends and my crush who left the country like Joseph to save their lives and those of their children. I also thought about the death of bad leadership and the return of the children of those who had ‘japad’. They would return to save the country as Jesus did to his people. I stopped the thought because I did not want to give in to hope again: I did not want healing. Yet hope would not give up.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        The ushers, not wanting to annoy the priest with another announcement, displayed on the projector that a medical personnel was needed outside for an emergency. Hope showed me the chivalry that hovered above the doctors and nurses who answered the call to humanity. I felt my usual joyful admiration for the medical profession give room for hope. ‘These are Nigerians’, said hope, ‘And they are good people.’ I reminded it of the bad people who also caused many problems. Hope smiled, accepting the slight defeat. It would come back again.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Meanwhile, during the offertory, it went to the choir stand to seek the support of the now joyful singers. They found the chords to heavenly symphonies whose modulation from key to key unlocked door after door in my mind. My mind’s prisoners — joy, peace, faith, and love- left their cages by the work of soulful music. Then hope returned. Now it had human aid in the choir, and divine assistance in my former prisoners. It was not done yet. After holy communion, it sought and won the hearts of the congregation. And I wondered who I was before this army of hopeful people, singing in joyful thanksgiving. I was no match, so I sang, and hope smiled, and it sang a song of victory. Then it reminded me, when we stood to sing the Nigerian national anthem, that we were ‘one nation, bound in freedom, peace and unity.’ But I said to myself that it was hope that really bound us together as a nation.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        It is hope that really binds us together as a nation.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Sitting down, I remembered a post on social media that said you can never rob the African of his vitality and joy. I remembered slaves singing songs of despair and of hope while remembering their long-lost liberty, and only seeing their distant liberation through the telescope offered by hope. Despite the circumstances, they sang as we did today. Hope had been with them. And hope sat beside me today, smiling when I thought about my country and grinning when I thought about my crush. I had made a move for her attention, and I now had reasons to hope, and hope was here.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        The priest, whom I now discovered had been complicit with hope and was satisfied with their fruitful alliance, offered our prayers to the Lord of Earth and Sky through the plea of the Queen of Nigeria, as Mordecai did through Esther, and we said:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        “Hail Holy Queen, mother of mercy, hail our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To you do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To you do we send up our sighs morning and weeping in the vale of tears. Turn then most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy towards us. And after this our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Going home, I hoped that one day, after the struggle of good people, we would be truly independent and happy.
