                <p>Dear Friends,
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        When one takes his life without leaving a note, he leaves his loved ones, haters, and gist lovers wondering why he ended things. He leaves them speculating what may have gone wrong, and so they take up for themselves self-assigned missions, compulsory missions to jump to the most plausible conclusion. I would not like to leave you in the dark when I go to see the light on the other side of reality. I want you to share in my light, or in the darkness that drives me into this light. So here is my suicide note.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Life has been hard, like really hard. I am a young man living in a country that has obvious plans to stifle the youthful generation. Even more, it has no plans for the generation unborn. So finding a clear path, a lucid vision, or a chivalrous purpose seems elusive in this region with no good plans for the inevitable future generation, a region where good people are mocked with the continuous rewarding of sharp practices. And this often leads me to the sullen chamber of despair where I hear consoling whispers to let go, and to end things.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        I am yet to let go of life, but I have let go of eating twice a day. I am glad to survive on a meal and a half. I try to console myself that half-bread is better than none. But recently, with the economic uncertainty in the polity, half a loaf now sells for the price of one. So I wonder what to eat every day, and end up going back to bed with a mourning abdomen.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        And while I mourn a country without a vision, I still see young people, old people, and generations in between, celebrating the monsters of tribalism, political sycophancy, and religious bigotry. I never forget the day a government worker told me that a position I applied for would never be given to a person from my tribe and that my religion had enough people in his office. His disdain made me seek ways to abandon this unholy celebration, to japa to a society that might be hostile at first but had some reward for merit and a future promise of integration. This decision cost me almost all the money I had.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        My desire to leave this bereaved motherland cost me more than money. I lost relationships. I had desired to keep my japa plans close to my chest. I left my close friends in the dark. I wanted to tell them when things were in the certainty of the final stages, but somehow my secret plans decided to become a public service announcement. My best friend was hurt, and my girlfriend could not forgive the distrust- she said she would rather date a tse-tse fly than forgive me. I hated myself for doing this. It is needless to say that the japa plans failed.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        A relationship that survived my failed japa plans was my toxic rapport with work. My salary is not able to compete with the soaring prices of basic commodities, and I work all the time. Yet I have to stay there because I have to eat at least a meal per day (until some miracle manifests). But I am getting tired. I would have loved an unwholesome friendship with the green bottle or some white pills or some bad smokes, but my salary would not tolerate that. Notwithstanding, I need a new relationship because I am alone.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        I know this note is getting too long, and that it should be pessimistic, but some good things happened recently. My aggrieved girlfriend forgave me, my best friend is speaking with me again, and I am being considered for an offer with a pay that can compete with the soaring prices of things. I sincerely have a feeling that good things are coming, yet I have a greater feeling that something bad will stop them from reaching my threshold. So you see why I have to leave before I meet such disappointment.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        So, friends, this is why I am taking my life: I am alone in a struggle that is beyond my strength, and I need help.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Help. But our help is in the name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth; for he knows the plans that he has for us, plans of good and not of evil, to give us a future and hope.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Hope. What is life without hope? What is science without belief? Who makes plans without faith? Nonetheless, I am still taking my life. LOL.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        As I drop my pen, I am taking my life, and I am giving it to Christ, again. So it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
        Peace.
