            So Google renamed Bard, its AI model, to become Gemini. I was intrigued that Gemini could generate images for free. And so I fancied using Gemini
            over Chat GPT for personal stuff. It cannot generate human images because of a fault that made it unable to generate images of white people.
            But it could generate images of other things, like this Nwanza.
            </p>
            <p>The prompt that generated this beautiful image did not have 'generate the image of a bird'
            in it. I had wanted a picture that portrayed variation in maths, and Gemini decided to give me a bird with varying colours amongst other suggestions.
            So I thought, 'Why not design and build a website inspired by the Nwanza - the bird in the Igbo stories.'

            <p>So here we go! Welcome to Stanley's Nwanza!</p>

                        <p>Dear Friends, <br>

                            When one takes his life without leaving a note, he leaves his loved ones, haters, and gist lovers wondering why he ended things. 
                            He leaves them speculating what may have gone wrong, and so they take up for themselves self-assigned missions, compulsory missions to jump to the most plausible conclusion. 
                            I would not like to leave you in the dark when I go to see the light on the other side of reality. 
                            I want you to share in my light, or in the darkness that drives me into this light. 
                            So here is my suicide note.</p>

                        <p>I did not feel independent or happy this morning. Yet I struggled to suppress hope which, 
                            like a joyful friend, tickled my sad mind in a bid to make me smile. 
                            It spoke of joy which came in the morning, but I would have none of that. 
                            Last Independence Day, I had posted: ‘Evening came, and morning came: a new dawn.’ 
                            Although that dawn was new, it came with the old reoccurrence of Nigerian tragedies.</p>
